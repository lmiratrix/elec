\description{
This is for measure W in Yolo County, CA, November 2008.  The file includes
precinct-level reports.

In the actual audit, 6 precincts were selected (see example) and audited by
hand-to-eye count by a group of 4 people cross-checking each other. One of
the 6 batches had underreported the "yes" votes by 1, and one had
overreported the "yes" votes by 1.  There were no other errors.

# Make an elec.data object out of precicnt-level results
data(yolo)
yolo = make.Z( yolo, C.names=c("y","n","under","over"), tot.votes.col="b" ) 

# Look at different sample sizes and cuts for setting aside
# small precincts
CAST.calc.opt.cut( yolo, beta=0.75, stages=1, t=5, plot=TRUE )

print( yolo )

# Get details of the audit plan -- expected work, etc.
ap <- CAST.calc.sample( yolo, beta=0.75, stages=1, t=5, small.cut=5 )
print( ap )

# Draw a sample (seed not used for actual audit)
CAST.sample(yolo, ap, seed=12345678)
