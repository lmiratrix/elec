\description{
\code{santa.cruz} and \code{santa.cruz.audit} hold data from a Santa Cruz
County, CA, contest held in November, 2008, for County Supervisor in the 1st
District.  The competitive candidates were John Leopold and Betty Danner.
According to the semi-official results provided to us by the Santa Cruz
County Clerk's office, Leopold won with votes on 45\% of the 26,655 ballots.
Danner received the votes on 37\% of the ballots.  The remaining ballots
were undervoted, overvoted, or had votes for minor candidates.

\code{santa.cruz} holds the semi-official results for the race.
\code{santa.cruz.audit} holds the audit totals for the random sample of
precincts selected for the audit.  Note the \code{santa.cruz.audit} vote
counts are larger for some precincts due the missing provisional ballot
counts in the semi-official results.
