\title{Election Audit Error Bound Functions}
\usage{
maximumMarginBound(Z, votes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{The elec.data object.}

\item{votes}{The data.frame to compute the maximumMarginBounds for.  If
null, will return all bounds for all precincts in Z.}

\item{frac}{Fraction of total votes that could be a winner
overstatement/loser understatement.  So if the worst-case is a 20\% flip
then enter 0.4}
}
\value{
Vector (of length of precincts) of maximum possible error for each
precinct.
}
\description{
Various bounding functions used to bound the maximum amount of error one
could see in a single audit unit.

maximumMarginBound return the maximum margin reduction for each precint by
computing all margin reductions between pairs of winners & losers and then
scaling by that pair's total margin to get a proportion and then taking the
max of all such proportions (usually will be the last winner to the closest
loser).
