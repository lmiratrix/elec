\title{ weight functions }
\description{
 This function produces weight functions to reweight found audit
  miscounts.
}
\usage{
weight.function(name = c("no.weight", "weight",
             "weight.and.slop", "margin.weight",
             "taint"))
}

\arguments{
  \item{name}{ name of function desired }
}
\details{
 The functions are      no weighting,          weighted by size of precint,
          weight by size, after a slop of 2 votes has been taken off,
  and weighing for pairwise margin tests, and finally, the taint weight
  function that takes maximum error in precincts and gives a ratio of
  actual error to maximum error.

}
\value{
  A two-element list of two functions, the second being the inverse of
  the first.  All the functions have three parameters, x, b\_m, and M,
  which are the things to
  weight, the bound on votes (or maximum error in precincts), and the
  (smallest) margin.
