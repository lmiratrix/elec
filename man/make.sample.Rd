\title{ make.sample and friends }
\description{
These methods are for SIMULATION STUDIES.  These functions will build a sample, i.e. simulated, record of votes
given certain parameters.
}
\usage{
make.cartoon(n = 400, vote.dist = c(125, 113, 13),
             stratify = TRUE)
make.sample(M, N, strata = 1, per.winner = NULL,
                 worst.e.max = NULL, R = NULL,
                 tot.votes = 1e+05)
make.sample.from.totals(vote.W, vote.L, totals)
make.sample.from.totals.margin(M, totals, per.winner = NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{M}{ The margin desired between the winner and loser (as a percent). }
  \item{N}{ Number of precincts desired. }
  \item{strata}{ Number of strata desired. }
  \item{per.winner}{ The percent of votes the winner should receive. }
  \item{worst.e.max}{ The worst e.max possible for any precinct. }
  \item{R}{ The "dispersion" a measure of how unequal in size precincts
  should be.  R needs to be greater than 0.  NULL indicates equal size.
  For R between 0 and 1, the precincts are distributed 'linearly', i.e.,
  the size of precinct i is proportional to i.  At 2, the smallest
  precint will be near 0 and the largest twice the average votes per
  precinct.  After 2, the precincts are distributed in a more curved
  fashion so that the smaller precincts do not go negative.}
  \item{tot.votes}{ The total votes desired. }
  \item{vote.W}{ Total votes for winner. }
  \item{vote.L}{ Total votes for loser. }
  \item{totals}{ Vector of total votes for precincts. }
  \item{vote.dist}{ reported votes for C1, C2, and C3 in order for all precincts.prompt }
  \item{n}{Size of sample.}
  \item{stratify}{ Should the sample be stratified? }
}
\details{
  make.cartoon() makes the sample scenario described in Stark's CAST paper.

## Note how they have different precinct sizes.
